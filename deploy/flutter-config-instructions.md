FLUTTER APP CONFIGURATION UPDATE

To update your Flutter app to use the new AWS API endpoint:

1. Copy the contents of 'flutter-app-config.env' to your Flutter app's '.env' file:
   `ash
   cp flutter-app-config.env ../iot-discovery-flutter-app/.env
   `

2. Or manually update the API_BASE_URL in your .env file to:
   API_BASE_URL=http://tethral-dev-alb-117782138.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com

3. Rebuild your Flutter app:
   `ash
   cd ../iot-discovery-flutter-app
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter build apk  # for Android
   flutter build ios  # for iOS
   `

4. Test the connection:
   - The app will now connect to your AWS-deployed API
   - All device discovery and orchestration features will work
   - The API endpoints are fully implemented and ready
