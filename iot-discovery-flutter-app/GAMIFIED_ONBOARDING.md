   final onboardingService = ref.read(onboardingServiceProvider);
   await onboardingService.initialize(
     analyticsService: analyticsService,
     notificationService: notificationService,
   );
   ```

3. **Navigate to Onboarding**
   ```dart
   Navigator.push(
     context,
     MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => const OnboardingPage()),
   );
   ```

### Basic Usage

#### Capture a Device
```dart
final deviceCapture = await onboardingService.captureDevice(
  deviceId: 'device_123',
  deviceName: 'Smart Speaker',
  deviceType: 'smart_speaker',
  deviceData: {'verified': true},
  photoFile: imageFile,
);
```

#### Collect a Photo
```dart
final photoCollectible = await onboardingService.collectPhoto(
  title: 'My Setup',
  description: 'My smart home setup',
  type: PhotoCollectibleType.setupPhoto,
  photoFile: imageFile,
  metadata: {'location': 'living_room'},
);
```

#### Update Quest Progress
```dart
await onboardingService.updateQuestProgress(
  questId: 'first_device',
  progress: 1,
  objective: 'capture_device',
);
```

## üé® Customization

### Themes
The system uses Material Design 3 theming and automatically adapts to light/dark modes.

### Colors
Customize colors through the theme:
```dart
ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
    seedColor: Colors.blue,
    // Customize primary, secondary, tertiary colors
  ),
)
```

### Animations
All animations are customizable through the animation controllers:
- Fade animations: 300-800ms
- Scale animations: 600ms with elastic curves
- Staggered animations: 500-600ms delays

### Points System
Modify point values in the configuration:
```dart
final pointValues = {
  'device_capture': 50,
  'photo_collectible': 30,
  'quest_completion': 100,
  'achievement_unlock': 200,
};
```
