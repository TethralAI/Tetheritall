## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- [ ] All services reorganized according to new architecture
- [ ] Basic protocol handlers implemented
- [ ] Security consent system working
- [ ] Configuration updated

### Phase 2 Complete When:
- [ ] All shared frameworks implemented
- [ ] Database schema updated
- [ ] API server updated with new endpoints
- [ ] Basic functionality working

### Phase 3 Complete When:
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] End-to-end functionality verified
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
1. **Complexity**: Break down into smaller, manageable tasks
2. **Integration**: Use comprehensive testing
3. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize continuously
4. **Security**: Implement security-first approach

### Timeline Risks:
1. **Scope creep**: Stick to defined architecture
2. **Dependencies**: Plan dependencies carefully
3. **Resources**: Allocate sufficient time and resources

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Start with Step 1.1**: Reorganize services directory
2. **Create protocol handlers**: Begin with WiFi and Bluetooth
3. **Enhance security**: Implement basic consent system
4. **Update configuration**: Add new environment variables

This plan provides a clear roadmap from the current state to the full Tethral architecture while maintaining system stability and functionality throughout the transition.
