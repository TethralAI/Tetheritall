## Integration Points

### 1. Connection Agent Integration
The main `ConnectionAgent` has been enhanced to integrate all Phase 2 components:

- **Initialization**: All Phase 2 components are initialized during agent startup
- **Event Handling**: Automatic event subscription and handling
- **State Management**: Device state updates during connection lifecycle
- **Communication**: Integrated communication management for device interactions

### 2. API Server Integration
The FastAPI server has been extended with Phase 2 endpoints:

#### New API Endpoints:
- **Device Registry**: `/devices`, `/devices/{device_id}`, `/devices/statistics`
- **State Management**: `/devices/{device_id}/state`, `/devices/states`, `/devices/states/statistics`
- **Communication**: `/devices/{device_id}/command`, `/communication/statistics`
- **Event System**: `/events`, `/events/statistics`

#### Enhanced Health Check:
- Phase 2 service status monitoring
- Component availability tracking
